# What is Squash?

Squash is going to be a 2D rendering engine for HTML 5.

It is written in CoffeeScript.

## What should I call it?!

I actually don't really like the name Squash. But I couldn't find
another name for it. So I would like suggestions for better names.

Since sprites are a central part of the rendering engine, I stuck
with Squash because it is a danish soft drink (though it is made with
oranges and has no similarity to Sprite).

## Usage

Since I haven't written any code yet, this is just a vague sketch of how
I imagine it should be used.

Feel free to suggest improvements!

```coffeescript
canvas = document.createElement 'canvas'
screen = new Screen canvas
scene = Screen.buildScene 'map.gif', ['texture1.gif', 'texture2.gif']
sprite = new Sprite 'sprites.gif', offset_x, offset_y, width, height
scene.render sprite, x_pos, y_pos
```
